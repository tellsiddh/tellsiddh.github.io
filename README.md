{steps: [\n    explanation: \"First, we need to isolate the variable x. Subtract 7 from both sides of the equation to get 8x = -26.\",\n    output: \"8x = -26\",\n\n    explanation: \"Next, divide both sides of the equation by 8 to find the value of x. Be sure to change the sign of the right side when dividing by a negative number.\",\n    output: \"x = -3.25\",\n\n    explanation: \"So, x = -3.25 is the solution.\",\n    output: \"\",\n\n    final_answer: \"-3.25\"\n]}
